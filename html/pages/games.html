    <h2>GAME PROJECTS</h2>
    <p>A collection of game projects I have worked on over the years, primarily using Unreal Engine 5. These will
        typically be smaller in scope than a full game, and may only showcase a single level or mechanic, but the
        skills I learned while making them has proven valuable.</p>
