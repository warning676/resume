        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <div class="page-intro">
            <p>Hi, I'm Benjamin "Ben" Reynolds. I'm currently based in Puyallup, Washington, where I'm pursuing my degree remotely
                through Southern New Hampshire University. In high school I made a bunch of different projects with a
                good
                friend Seth. We worked on a ton of video projects and some game projects. I'm hoping to get into
                game development as I really enjoy programming games and creating something I want to make. Go ahead and
                look around to find more information about me.</p>

        <h2>DEVIOUS DUO PRODUCTIONS</h2>
        <div class="page-intro">
            <p>Devious Duo Productions was a name Seth and I came up with as a joke in sophomore year during video production class. It started as just a joke, but we ended up using it for all of our videos together. We created a signature intro for our videos that featured our logo and to let people know they were watching Devious Duo Productions.</p>
